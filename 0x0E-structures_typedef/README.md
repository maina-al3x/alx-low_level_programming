A struct in the C programming language is:

a composite data type (or record) declaration that defines a physically grouped list of variables under one name in a block of memory, allowing the different variables to be accessed via a single pointer or by the struct declared name which returns the same address.

Typedef:

allows you to introduce synonyms for types which could have been declared some other way. The new name becomes equivalent to the type that you wanted
