C preprocessor modifies a source code file before it goes to the compiler

There are essentially three uses of the preprocessor--directives, constants, and macros.

Directives are commands that tell the preprocessor to skip part of a file, include another file, or define a constant or macro.

Directives always begin with a sharp sign (#) and for readability should be placed flush to the left of the page.

All other uses of the preprocessor involve processing #define'd constants or macros.

Constants and macros are written in ALL CAPS
