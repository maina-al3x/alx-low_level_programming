A bit is the most basic unit in computing

bit manipulation is thus handling bits in a skillful or clever way

bit manipulation allows for rogram optimization at the  most basic level

1 byte is made up og 8 bits.

Bits cn be expressed either in binary or base 2 form (check if there are more*)

Bit manipulation is made possible by the use of Bitwise operators;
These are:
NOT ( ~ ): Bitwise NOT is an unary operator that flips the bits of the number

AND ( & ): Bitwise AND is a binary operator that operates on two equal-length bit patterns. If both bits in the compared position of the bit patterns are 1, the bit in the resulting bit pattern is 1, otherwise 0.

OR ( | ): Bitwise OR is also a binary operator that operates on two equal-length bit patterns, similar to bitwise AND. If both bits in the compared position of the bit patterns are 0, the bit in the resulting bit pattern is 0, otherwise 1

OR ( | ): Bitwise OR is also a binary operator that operates on two equal-length bit patterns, similar to bitwise AND. If both bits in the compared position of the bit patterns are 0, the bit in the resulting bit pattern is 0, otherwise 1

Left Shift ( << ): Left shift operator is a binary operator which shift the some number of bits, in the given bit pattern, to the left and append 0 at the end.

Right Shift ( >> ): Right shift operator is a binary operator which shift the some number of bits, in the given bit pattern, to the right and append 1 at the end.
