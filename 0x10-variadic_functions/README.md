Variadic functions are a syntax for declaring a function to take a variable number or type of arguments

Since it doesnt provide a mechanism for such functions to access their non-required arguments,
you use the variable arguments macros defined in stdarg.h.

stdarg.h is:

a header in the C standard library of the C programming language that allows functions to accept an indefinite number of arguments
